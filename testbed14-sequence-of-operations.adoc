== Sequence of deployment and execution operations

=== Summary

This section provides the steps of the sequence of operations required for deploying and executing both applications and workflows:

1. Alice deploys a newly developed application
2. Alice's sister discovers the new application and build a workflow including that application.
3. Alice's sister deploys the workflow.
4. Bob discovers the new workflow and execute it.

The execution of workflow or an application on the EMS internally includes the following steps:

[start=5]
5. Discovery of the EO Image products using the catalogs gateway.
6. Deployment on ADES
7. Execution on ADES

Note that the security and billing aspects are not covered as they belong to the scope of the D010 Engineering report. 

=== Sequence

The sequence is shown on the diagram below:

image::testbed14-sequence.png[]

The execution of the application (step 1') is not covered as the steps are strictly similar to the execution of the workflow.

=== 1. Application deployment

Alice developed an application identified as 'MultiSensorNDVI'. She wants to make this application available to the users of the Thematic Exploitation Platform.

Using the EMS Client, Alice performs a Deployment request (step 1). The operation relies on the WPS Transactional REST/JSON interface specification, and the request message includes the following items:

* The process offering: a standard (WPS) description of the application interface used by the client. In particular, it includes a project-specific flag (EOImage) for Earth Observation Image inputs, and it also references a CWL file providing information on the Docker image of the application. 
* The execution unit: the application binaries, packages and resources which is, in this case, a reference to the Docker image.
* The identifier of the profile (Dockerized application).

  }
}

=== 2. Application discovery and workflow design

Alice's sister is preparing a processing chain workflow. She first needs to discover the applications available on the Thematic Exploitation Platform (step 2). 
The EMS Client can list the available processes using the _/processes_ REST path. The list includes a summary of the deployed processes.

[source,json]
----
{
  "processes": [
    {
      "id": "NDVIMultiSensor",
      "title": "NDVIMultiSensor",
      "jobControlOptions": [
        "async-execute"
      ],
      "outputTransmission": [
        "reference"
      ],
      "processDescriptionURL": "http://185.52.193.7/wps-proxy/processes/GeomatysNDVIMultiSensor"
    }
  ]
}
----

The agreed language for the workflow is CWL. Therefore, for each application that Alice plans to include in the workflow, the CWL file of the application needs to be retrieved by the client using a description process operation. The document is retrieved by invoking the _/processes/${processId}_ REST path. The response includes the CWL reference which was provided in the OWS Context metadata during deployment.

[source,json]
----
{
  "process": {
    "id": "GeomatysNDVIMultiSensor",
    "title": "NDVIMultiSensor",
    "abstract": "Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) from an input list of satellite images.",
    "owsContext": {

  "processVersion": "1.0.0",
  "jobControlOptions": [
    "async-execute"
  ],
  "outputTransmission": [
    "reference"
  ]
}
----

Note that the input and output description parts have been removed from the example and will be covered in the workflow execution step (step 4).

Alice's sister can compose her CWL workflow using her prefered CWL workflow designer tool and import the various applications CWL files for building the workflow steps.

Before deploying the generated workflow, it has been agreed for the run property of each workflow step that:

* The CWL file name is equal to the WPS process identifier
* The local file path is removed
*

=== 3. Workflow Deployment

Alice's sister composed the Multi Sensor NDVI Stacker processing chains. The chain performs a Multi Sensor NDVI processing on each of the 3 received EO Image inputs then Stack the generated outputs, as illustrated on the diagram below.

Alice's sister prepares the Process Description for deploying the processing chain workflow, and use the client to perform the deployment request.

    ],
    "deploymentProfileName": "http://www.opengis.net/profiles/eoc/workflow"
}
----

The client receives a deployment confirmation message as already described earlier.

=== 4. Workflow Execution

When a workflow (but also an application) process description is requested by the EMS client, the returned document differs from the one that was submitted by Alice. Indeed, the description of EO Image input is replaced by fields required to perform a OpenSearch Catalog query. The EMS is responsible to retrieve the EO Image references by performing a Catalog search and pass the returned products URLs. 

Therefore, the process description returned by the EMS looks as illustrated below.

=== 4. EMS Catalog Search

EMS internally performs the OpenSearch gateway search of products to retrieve the list of products URLs. The internal steps are provided below:

* The EMS retrievese OpenSearch Description Document (OSDD) for the requested collection:

....
  curl -X GET \
       -i "http://geo.spacebel.be/opensearch/description.xml?parentIdentifier=COLLECTION_ID" \
....

The returned document (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spacebel/testbed14/master/OpenSearch_SSARA_OSDD.xml[Catalog SSARA Collection OSDD]) includes the Dataset Search request template for the desired response format (i.e. atom/xml):

[source,xml]
----
<Url indexOffset="1" pageOffset="1" rel="results" template="http://geo.spacebel.be/opensearch/request?httpAccept=application%2Fatom%2Bxml&amp;parentIdentifier=EOP:SSARA&amp;query={searchTerms?}&amp;startDate={time:start?}&amp;endDate={time:end?}&amp;geometry={geo:geometry?}&amp;platform={eo:platform?}&amp;orbitNumber={eo:orbitNumber?}&amp;frame={eo:frame?}&amp;sensorMode={eo:sensorMode?}&amp;swathIdentifier={eo:swathIdentifier?}&amp;orbitDirection={eo:orbitDirection?}&amp;antennaLookDirection={eo:antennaLookDirection?}&amp;polarisationChannels={eo:polarisationChannels?}&amp;processingLevel={eo:processingLevel?}&amp;maximumRecords={count?}&amp;uid={geo:uid?}&amp;name={geo:name?}&amp;lat={geo:lat?}&amp;lon={geo:lon?}&amp;radius={geo:radius?}&amp;recordSchema={sru:recordSchema?}&amp;bbox={geo:box?}&amp;startRecord={startIndex?}&amp;strict=true" type="application/atom+xml">		
----

* The EMS builds the URL request from the template by replacing the following parameter codes:
** geo:box : AOI
** time:start : TOI start date
** time:end : TOI end date

....
  curl -X GET \
       -i "http://geo.spacebel.be/opensearch/request?parentIdentifier=COLLECTION_OD&startDate=TOI_START&endDate=TOI_END&bbox=AOI]&httpAccept=application/atom%2Bxml \
....

* The returned document (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spacebel/testbed14/master/OpenSearch_Dataset_Search.xml[OpenSearch Dataset Search]) is a list of entries that include:
** The link to the products (with @rel = 'enclosure')
** The associated WPS endpoint

* EMS decision: based on the response, the EMS is able to define the relevant ADES (based on the OWS Context attribute) and to build the image input (list).


=== 5. EMS Deployment on ADES

EMS deploys the Application(s). The deployment request is based strictly on the document (JSON or XML) provided on step 1. However, as agreed, it also embbeds in the Process Offering the information from the CWL (in ows:AdditionalParameters element).

The Deploy Request becomes:

==== Others 

TODO: the workflow part looks very similar to the other steps, but the examples are not created yet.

* Alice deploys the Workflow. For the WPS-T encoding, the <ExecutionUnit> part is not the Docker Image anymore but the workflow CWL (example not yet ready). The Process Description includes EO Image input. In the DescribeProcess response, the EMS also generates a Descripiton with the corresponding OpenSearch Gateway inputs (this step is missing on the diagram).

* Bob invokes the WPS 2.0 Execute operation (encoding XML or JSON). The inputs includes the OpenSearch Gateway inputs (i.e. CollectionId, AOI, TOI).

* EMS internally performs the OpenSearch gateway search of products to retrieve the list of products URLs. Based on the CollectionId from the request inputs, EMS also selects the relevant MEP.

* EMS deploys the Application(s) (using the original Process Description, not the generated one). Same format and encoding as step 1. The target MEP is selected based on CollectionId.

* EMS invokes the WPS 2.0 Execute operation (encoding XML or JSON) on the workflow. The inputs includes the OpenSearch results URLs.

* The workflow executes the Application on the relevant MEP.
